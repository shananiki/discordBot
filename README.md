# discordBot
Saves pictures sent to discord channels "general" or "spam" and makes them visible in a gallery.
In memory of the old "pr0gramm".

## What can it do by now?

For now only .mp4, .webm, .jpg, .png and .jpeg file extensions are supported.

## Preparation VPS
sudo apt-get install apache2\
sudo apt-get install php7.4\
sudo apt-get install php7.4-sqlite


I recommend using [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/)\
Use the [SQL file](https://github.com/shananiki/discordBot/blob/main/createDB.sql) to create a database ".db" file called images.db.
