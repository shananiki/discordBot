# discordBot
Saves pictures sent to discord channels "general" or "spam" and makes them visible in a gallery.
In memory of the old "pr0gramm".

## What can it do by now?

For now only .jpg, .png and .jpeg file extensions are supported.

## Preparation VPS
sudo apt-get install apache2\
sudo apt-get install php7.4\
sudo apt-get install php7.4-sqlite

Use the SQL file to create a database ".db" file called images.db.
